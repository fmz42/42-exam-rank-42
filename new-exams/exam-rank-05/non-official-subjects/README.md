# üìö Exam Rank 05 - Non-Official Subjects

This directory contains **non-official subject files** for the exercises found in the Exam Rank 05 structure.

## üìÇ Exercise Structure

Based on the existing implementations, the Exam Rank 05 has the following structure:

### **Level 1 - C++ Classes & OOP**
- **string_bigint**: Big integer arithmetic using strings
- **vect2**: 2D vector class with mathematical operations  
- **practice_bigint**: Simplified version of bigint for practice

### **Level 2 - Advanced C Algorithms**
- **bsq**: Biggest Square algorithm (from Piscine)
- **game_of_life**: Conway's Game of Life implementation

## üéØ Exercise Categories

### **Object-Oriented Programming (C++)**
- Class design and implementation
- Constructor/destructor management
- Operator overloading
- Container usage (std::vector, std::string)
- Stream operators
- Memory management with RAII

### **Advanced Algorithms (C)**
- Dynamic programming (BSQ)
- Cellular automata (Game of Life)
- Complex parsing and validation
- Efficient matrix operations

## üîç Detailed Exercise Analysis

### **Level 1 Exercises:**

1. **string_bigint**:
   - Implement arbitrary precision arithmetic
   - String-based number storage
   - Operator overloading (+, -, *, =, <<)
   - Constructor variety (default, int, string, copy)

2. **vect2**:
   - 2D vector mathematics
   - std::vector<int> container usage
   - Vector operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication)
   - Clean operator overloading

3. **practice_bigint**:
   - Simplified version for learning
   - Focus on basic addition algorithm
   - Understanding digit-by-digit arithmetic

### **Level 2 Exercises:**

1. **bsq** (Biggest Square):
   - Find largest square in a grid avoiding obstacles
   - Dynamic programming solution
   - File parsing and validation
   - Complex grid manipulation

2. **game_of_life**:
   - Conway's Game of Life simulation
   - Command-based drawing system
   - Cellular automata rules
   - Multi-generation evolution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Non-Official Status**: These subjects are reconstructed based on existing implementations and may not match the exact official format.

2. **Language Separation**: 
   - **Level 1**: Pure C++ with OOP focus
   - **Level 2**: Pure C with algorithmic focus

3. **Difficulty Progression**: 
   - Level 1: Master C++ fundamentals
   - Level 2: Solve complex algorithmic challenges

4. **Real Exam Structure**: The actual exam may have different exercises or requirements.
